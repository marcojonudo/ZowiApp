# ZowiApprende
ZowiApprende is an Android app with which it is possible to interact with Zowi, the BQ educational robot. 

The spanish company already provides the necessary Android software to control Zowi, but it has an important shortcoming when refering to learning: it has been developed to show the available possibilities, but it is not focused on making childs learn about any topic.

ZowiApprende was born, therefore, as a project that could be taken to chilhood education classes. Adapting and taking advantage of the robot sensors and components, different activities have been designed with the help of a teacher. This way, childs are able to learn about healthy habits, their home, school or personal hygiene.

## Use of different Arduino sensors
Zowi packs an Arduino motherboard with a set of sensors, as sound detector or ultrasound.

## Component expansion
As new functionality is required, new components have been tested (like different types of IMUs and proximity sensors) and others have been incorporated into Zowi (like different color LEDS).

## 3D print
Taking into account that new components require extra space, a new chasis have been designed.

## Child-centered layout
The whole layout is easy to use, with big buttons, few text and a lot of images to make it usable for kids.

## Two different sections
Free and guided activities are available, each of them with several exercises where kids can learn and practise with Zowi.
